<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heel Pressure Injury Relieving Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Low Pressure Devices</li><li>Alternating Pressure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heel pressure injury relieving devices are essential for preventing pressure ulcers, especially in individuals with limited mobility. Constant low pressure devices maintain a steady, gentle pressure across the heel, promoting blood circulation and reducing localized pressure. In contrast, alternating pressure devices utilize cycles of inflating and deflating air chambers, redistributing weight and alleviating pressure points more dynamically. Both types are crucial in clinical settings for enhancing patient comfort and safety by minimizing the risk of heel pressure injuries.</p></p>
