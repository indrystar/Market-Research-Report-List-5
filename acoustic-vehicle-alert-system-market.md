<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acoustic Vehicle Alert System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Acoustic Vehicle Alert System (AVAS) market comprises two key segments: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs, powered entirely by electric energy, require AVAS to alert pedestrians due to their near-silent operation at low speeds. PHEVs, which combine electric and conventional powertrains, also benefit from AVAS to enhance safety when operating in electric mode. Both markets focus on improving urban safety and compliance with regulations aimed at reducing risks to vulnerable road users.</p></p>
