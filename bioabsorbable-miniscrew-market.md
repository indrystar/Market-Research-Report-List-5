<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioabsorbable Miniscrew Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PLLA Miniscrews</li><li>PGA Miniscrews</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioabsorbable miniscrew market features primarily two types: PLLA (Poly-L-lactic Acid) and PGA (Polyglycolic Acid) miniscrews. PLLA miniscrews are popular for their strength and slower absorption rate, making them ideal for long-term support in dental and orthopedic applications. In contrast, PGA miniscrews absorb more quickly, promoting faster healing but providing shorter-term support. Both types cater to the growing demand for biocompatible solutions in surgical procedures, minimizing the need for additional surgical removal.</p></p>
