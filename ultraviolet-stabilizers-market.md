<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet Stabilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer (HALS)</li><li>UV Absorbers</li><li>Quenchers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultraviolet Stabilizers market consists of three primary types: Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers (HALS), UV Absorbers, and Quenchers. HALS are effective in preventing degradation by scavenging free radicals, thereby extending the lifespan of materials. UV Absorbers, on the other hand, absorb UV radiation and convert it into harmless heat, protecting substrates from damage. Quenchers dissipate absorbed energy, preventing photo-induced reactions. Together, these stabilizers enhance the durability and performance of various materials exposed to UV light, particularly in plastics and coatings.</p></p>
