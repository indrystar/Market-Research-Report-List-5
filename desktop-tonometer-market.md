<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Tonometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Noncontact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desktop tonometer market is primarily divided into two types: contact and non-contact tonometers. Contact tonometers, such as applanation tonometers, require direct contact with the eye to measure intraocular pressure, providing precise readings but requiring proper hygiene and skill. Non-contact tonometers, often using a puff of air, measure eye pressure without touching the eye, enhancing patient comfort and reducing the risk of infection. Both types are essential in ophthalmology for diagnosing and managing conditions like glaucoma.</p></p>
