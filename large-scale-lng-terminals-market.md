<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large-scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction</li><li>Regasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Large-scale LNG terminals are classified into two primary market types: liquefaction and regasification. Liquefaction terminals convert natural gas into liquid form for efficient transportation, typically involving cooling the gas to around -160Â°C. This process allows for easier shipping and storage. Regasification terminals, on the other hand, receive LNG and convert it back into gaseous form, making it suitable for distribution and use in power generation or consumption. Both types are essential for facilitating global LNG trade.</p></p>
