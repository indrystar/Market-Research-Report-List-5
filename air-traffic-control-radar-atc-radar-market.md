<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Traffic Control Radar (ATC-Radar) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Surveillance Radar</li><li>Secondary Surveillance Radar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air Traffic Control Radar (ATC-Radar) plays a crucial role in managing air traffic safety and efficiency. It is categorized into two main types: Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). PSR detects the position of aircraft by bouncing radar waves off physical objects, providing information on their location and altitude. In contrast, SSR relies on signals emitted by aircraft transponders, offering more detailed data such as identification and altitude, thus enhancing situational awareness for air traffic controllers.</p></p>
