<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Duty Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Encoder</li><li>Absolute Encoder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty encoders market primarily consists of two types: incremental encoders and absolute encoders. Incremental encoders provide position feedback by emitting a series of pulses as the shaft rotates, enabling relative position measurement. They are ideal for applications where precise speed and direction monitoring is crucial. Absolute encoders, on the other hand, generate a unique code for each position, allowing for accurate determination of the absolute position regardless of power loss. Both types are vital for various industrial automation applications.</p></p>
