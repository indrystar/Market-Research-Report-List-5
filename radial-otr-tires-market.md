<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial OTR Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial OTR (Off-The-Road) tires are essential for heavy-duty vehicles operating in challenging environments. The market is primarily divided into two types: inner tube and tubeless tires. Inner tube tires use a separate air-filled tube to maintain pressure, providing flexibility for repairs but can be more prone to punctures. Tubeless tires, on the other hand, have a sealed design that eliminates the need for an inner tube, offering improved durability, lower weight, and better responsiveness, making them increasingly popular in the industry.</p></p>
